### **Key Decisions**  
1. **Feature Scaling Implementation**:  
   - Applied StandardScaler to normalize feature distributions.
   - **Rationale**: SVM performance heavily depends on feature scales; normalization ensures optimal hyperplane placement.
   - **Impact**: Significantly improved convergence speed and classification performance.

2. **SMOTE for Class Imbalance**:  
   - Implemented synthetic oversampling to balance normal and anomalous classes.
   - **Justification**: Imbalanced datasets tend to bias models toward majority class; balancing improves learning of minority patterns.
   - **Trade-off**: Synthetic samples may introduce artificial patterns, but this risk is outweighed by improved recall.

3. **Nu Parameter Adjustment**:  
   - Increased nu from 0.2 to 0.35 based on expected anomaly ratio after balancing.
   - **Reasoning**: Higher nu allocates more training samples as support vectors, enhancing boundary complexity.
   - **Result**: Dramatic recall improvement (+83.3%) with minimal precision loss (-4.0%).

4. **Optimization Parameters**:  
   - Added explicit max_iter and tol parameters to control convergence.
   - **Importance**: Prevents premature stopping and ensures proper model fitting on complex, high-dimensional data.

### **Conclusion**  
The enhanced One-Class SVM model (ocsvm_bin_v2) demonstrates substantial performance improvements over the baseline version, achieving state-of-the-art results among all tested models with an F1-score of 0.829. The most significant advancement is the 83.3% increase in recall while maintaining high precision, suggesting effective learning of anomaly patterns. This balancing of precision and recall creates a more practical anomaly detection system suitable for real-world network security applications. The improved Davies-Bouldin indices also indicate better cluster separation despite slightly lower silhouette scores, suggesting more nuanced decision boundaries. These improvements highlight the critical importance of proper data preprocessing (scaling and balancing) in conjunction with parameter tuning for unsupervised anomaly detection. Future work should explore ensemble approaches combining the complementary strengths of One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest methods.
