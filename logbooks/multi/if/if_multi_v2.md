#### **Date**: February 14, 2025 – February 17, 2025 
**Objective**: Enhance the multiclass anomaly detection system by implementing optimized contamination parameters and addressing class imbalance issues to improve classification performance across all traffic categories, particularly for normal traffic and rare attack types like U2R and R2L.  

---

### **Work Summary**  
1. **Contamination Parameter Refinement**  
   - **Previous Approach**: Used fixed contamination (0.1 for normal, 0.5 for all attack classes).
   - **New Configuration**:  
     - Class 0 (Normal Traffic): Increased from 0.1 to 0.35
     - Class 1-3 (DOS, Probe, R2L): Reduced from 0.5 to 0.4
     - Class 4 (U2R): Significantly reduced from 0.5 to 0.25
   - **Rationale**: Adjusted parameters to better reflect actual class distributions and improve boundary definition between normal and attack traffic.

2. **SMOTE-Based Sample Balancing**  
   - **Targeted Approach**: Applied synthetic oversampling only to severely underrepresented classes.
   - **Resampling Strategy**:
     - Class 3 (R2L): Increased 5× from 796 to 3,980 samples
     - Class 4 (U2R): Increased 10× from 42 to 420 samples
     - Classes 0-2: Kept at original sizes
   - **Outcome**: More balanced overall class distribution while preserving authentic samples for well-represented classes.
   - **Final Distribution**:
     ```
     Class 0 (Normal Traffic): 53,874 samples (51.63%)
     Class 1 (DOS): 36,741 samples (35.21%)
     Class 2 (Probe): 9,325 samples (8.94%)
     Class 3 (R2L): 3,980 samples (3.81%) [⬆ from 0.79%]
     Class 4 (U2R): 420 samples (0.40%) [⬆ from 0.04%]
     ```

3. **Class-Specific Sampling Ratios**  
   - **Adaptive Approach**: Implemented class-specific normal-to-attack sample ratios.
   - **Ratio Configuration**:
     - Class 1 (DOS): 0.5:1 ratio (reduced normal samples to prevent DOS domination)
     - Class 2-3 (Probe, R2L): 2:1 ratio (moderate normal sample presence)
     - Class 4 (U2R): 1:1 ratio (equal representation for boundary learning)
   - **Training Sample Distribution**:
     - Class 0: 53,874 normal samples only
     - Class 1: 18,370 normal + 36,741 DOS samples
     - Class 2: 18,650 normal + 9,325 Probe samples
     - Class 3: 7,960 normal + 3,980 R2L samples
     - Class 4: 420 normal + 420 U2R samples

4. **Model Architecture Maintenance**  
   - **Core Framework**: Maintained one-vs-rest approach with separate Isolation Forest models.
   - **Base Parameters**: Kept consistent with v1 (200 trees, auto sample size).
   - **Classification Method**: Continued using minimum anomaly score for final class assignment.

- **Confusion Matrix (Test Set)**:  
  ```
  [[6308   48 1504 1504  347]  # Normal
   [ 236 5233 1090  891    8]  # DOS
   [   0  314 2106    0    1]  # Probe
   [ 898   97  861  474  557]  # R2L
   [   2    9   11   18   27]] # U2R
  ```
  - Normal traffic (class 0) correctly identified 65% of the time (vs. 2.4% in v1)
  - Probe attacks (class 2) show strongest detection performance at 87% recall
  - R2L attacks (class 3) show reduced recall but still 3× better precision
  - U2R attacks (class 4) now detected 40% of the time (vs. 9% in v1)

- **Training Efficiency**:
  - Increased computational load due to SMOTE processing and larger training sets
  - 20-30% longer training time compared to v1

### **Key Decisions**  
1. **Asymmetric Contamination Parameter Adjustment**:  
   - **Approach**: Applied class-specific contamination fine-tuning based on v1 analysis.
   - **Rationale**: Higher contamination for normal traffic significantly improved its detection rate; lower contamination for U2R reduced false positives.
   - **Impact**: 27× improvement in normal traffic recall with acceptable precision trade-offs.
   - **Evidence**: Confusion matrix shows dramatically fewer normal samples misclassified as R2L compared to v1.

2. **Selective SMOTE Application**:  
   - **Decision**: Applied SMOTE only to severely underrepresented classes (R2L and U2R).
   - **Justification**: Full SMOTE on all classes would create an extremely imbalanced dataset, distorting the natural traffic distribution.
   - **Trade-off**: Slight decrease in R2L recall compensated by 4.4× increase in U2R recall.
   - **Result**: More balanced overall performance across all attack types.

3. **Attack-Specific Normal:Attack Ratios**:  
   - **Strategy**: Varied normal sample ratios based on attack class characteristics.
   - **Reasoning**: Different attack types require different decision boundaries; DOS needs fewer normal samples to avoid overfitting, while U2R benefits from 1:1 ratio.
   - **Evidence**: Improved boundary definition led to 57% higher overall accuracy.

4. **Preserving Original Architecture**:  
   - **Choice**: Maintained the one-model-per-class approach rather than implementing a hierarchical model.
   - **Rationale**: Core architecture was sound; class imbalance and parameter tuning were the primary issues to address.
   - **Benefit**: Isolated the effects of contamination and sampling changes for clearer performance analysis.

### **Conclusion**  
The enhanced multiclass Isolation Forest model (if_multi_v2) demonstrates substantial performance improvements over v1, increasing overall accuracy from 40% to 63% on the test set. Most significantly, the model now correctly identifies 65% of normal traffic (up from just 2.4% in v1) while maintaining strong performance on DOS and Probe attacks. The targeted approach to contamination parameter tuning and selective oversampling of minority classes proved highly effective, validating the hypothesis that these were the primary limitations in the initial implementation.

While performance gains are impressive, several challenges remain. R2L attacks show reduced recall despite oversampling, likely due to their diverse patterns and similarity to normal traffic. The significant class distribution shift between training and test datasets (particularly for R2L) continues to present generalization challenges. Future work should focus on implementing a hierarchical detection approach to first separate normal from attack traffic before attack classification, exploring more sophisticated oversampling techniques for R2L attacks, and investigating feature engineering approaches to better distinguish between similar traffic patterns. These enhancements could further improve the model's utility for real-world network intrusion detection systems.
